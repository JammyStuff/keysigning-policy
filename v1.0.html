                <li>Nicknames are acceptable, as long as they are in double quotes and in the same UID as the real name (otherwise the requirements for Persona Verification must be met).</li>
                <li>Comments are acceptable, as long as they are in parentheses.</li>
                <li>If the UID contains an email address, the owner of the key must be able to demonstrate their ownership of that email address. This requirement is satisfied by me delivering the signed key to that email address.</li>
            </ul>
